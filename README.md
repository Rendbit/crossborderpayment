# RendBit Cross-Border Payment System

**RendBit** is building a financial solution that makes it easy for people across Africa to send and receive money across borders instantly, safely, and at extremely low cost.

## 🌍 What It Does

Sending money across African countries is often expensive, slow, and limited by strict banking policies. RendBit solves this by using blockchain technology to let users:

- Send money directly to family, friends, or business partners in other countries  
- Receive money from abroad without delays or hidden fees  
- Convert crypto (like USDC or XLM) into cash securely  
- Withdraw or deposit funds using bank accounts or mobile money  
- Save money in stable digital currencies that don’t lose value  

All of this is done without needing traditional banks, agents, or middlemen. Users only need their phone or computer.

## 🛠 How It Works (Simplified)

When a user wants to send money from one country to another, RendBit:

1. Converts the money into a digital currency (XLM)  
2. Instantly moves it across borders  
3. Converts it back into local currency for the recipient  
4. Delivers it directly to their bank or mobile wallet  

It takes a few seconds, and the costs are tiny—often less than a single cent.
